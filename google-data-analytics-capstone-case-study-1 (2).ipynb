The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes dierently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n    \n    Characters and teams\n    Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also oering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.\n    Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.\n    Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy. You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s mission and business goals — as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help Cyclistic achieve them.\n    Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.\n    \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ask-guiding\"></a>\n#### Guiding questions\n\n* **What is the problem you are trying to solve?**\n\nThe differences in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes and the best strategies for converting casual riders into members?\n\n* **How can your insights drive business decisions?**\n\nThe insights will help maximize the annual memberships by converting casual riders into annual members.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ask-key\"></a>\n#### Key Tasks\n1.

discover in the data?**\n\nFew of the noteable discoveries are \n1. That maximum ride duration out of all riders is 55944.15 minutes by a casual rider which is about 39 days !!!!\n2. That casual riders completely dominate the ride duration category for all seven days of the week !!! \n3. That maximum ride duration out of all riders for annual members is 33421.37 minutes by a casual rider which is about 23 days !!!!\n\n* **What trends or relationships did you find in the data?**\n * On an average the ride duration for casual riders is much more than the annual members.\n * Despite having more number of riders than casual riders for almost all seven days except for saturday and sunday, annual members contribute more for ride duration for all seven days of the week than annual members.\n * There are more members than casuals in the dataset.\n * There are more data points in the second half of 2020.\n * There is a huge difference between the flow of members/casual from midweek to weekends.\n * Both members and casual riders tend to prefer docked bikes.\n\n* **How will these insights help answer your business questions?**\n\nThis clearly shows that the current casual riders are dominating the annual members in certain statistical categories and converting them into annual members can boost the revenue of the company.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"analyze-key\"></a>\n#### Key tasks\n1.

But for kaggle, the best representation of the analysis and conclusions is it's own notebook.\n\nLet us look at our findings from the data so far to arrive on a conclusion.\n\nSo far we understood from the data that :\n* Despite data being taken equally from each year, 2020 has 8.61% more rides than 2021.\n* Also the second half of 2020 had more ride duration than first half of 2021.\n* The riders' favorite mode of transportation is docked bikes as it accounted for a whopping 47.2% of the rides.\n* Classic bike rides increased from 2020 to 2021 by a whopping 26.3%.\n* There are more members than casuals in the dataset.\n* Out of all the months, the month of june has the largest percentage of rides.\n* Out of all the days, Saturday accounts for the largest percentage of rides.\n* There is a big volume of riders from 9 am to 7 pm timeframe.\n* The volume of rides for weekends is less compared to weekdays.\n\nNow for how members differs from casuals :\n* There are more members than casuals in the dataset.\n* In month of June the casual riders and annual members almost account for equal percentage but differ by just 1.5% of the rides.\n* For Saturdays, the number of casual riders lead the annual members by 7.9%.\n* 9 am to 5 pm accounts for big volume of annual members and casual riders, but of volume of members is relatively lower.\n* In both midweek and weekend categories casual riders contribute for more rides than the annual members.\n* Casual riders completely dominate the ride duration category for all seven days of the week.\n* On an average the ride duration for casual riders is much more than the annual members.\n\n\nConcluding:\n\n* Annual members have a predefined schedule and fixed routes which they follow in order to spend less time on travelling.\n* Casual riders aren't satisfied with the current membership services which is why they hesitate converting to annual members.\n* It can be assumed that majority of the riders use bikes for their respective jobs which is indicated by the huge increase in volume of rides from 9 am to 5 pm.\n* The volume of rides varies according to the season.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"share-guiding\"></a>\n#### Guiding questions\n* **Were you able to answer the question of how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**\n\nYes, very interesting discoveries are made and data points to several differences between casuals and members.\n\n* **What story does your data tell?**\n\nDespite having a higher number of annual riders, our data shows that casual riders spend more time traveling, and there may be reasons why they do not convert to members, such as high subscription prices, fewer offers and services, and so on because converting to members can prove beneficial for them such as lowering the cost of rides using packages or deals offered by the company. The lower ride duration suggests that annual riders may have schedules fixed and have predefined routes they use for travelling daily.\n\n* **How do your findings relate to your original question?**\n\nThe findings prompt us to consider the fundamental differences between casual and annual riders, as well as what types of bikes they ride and why they do so, in order to determine \"How digital media could impact them.\"\n\n* **Who is your audience? What is the best way to communicate with them?**\n\nThe main target audience is my cyclistic marketing analytics team and Lily Moreno. The best way to communicate is through a slide presentation of the findings.\n\n* **Can data visualization help you share your findings?**\n\nYes, data visualization is at the heart of the findings.\n\n* **Is your presentation accessible to your audience?**\n\nYes, the plots and labels were created utilizing bold and unique colors.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"share-key\"></a>\n#### Key tasks\n1.
